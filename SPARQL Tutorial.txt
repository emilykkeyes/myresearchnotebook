SPARQL Tutorial

Notes:
RDF--information in 3 part statements, subject, predicate and object
SPARQL-translated interlinked graph data into normalized tabular data
SPARQL--A Mad lib. lets us search databases using a question to pull up matching statements: 
SELECT ?painting
WHERE {
  ?painting <has medium> <oil on canvas> .
}
Benefits fo RDF and SPARQL is it has the ability to ask complex queries with multiple variables:
SELECT ?artist ?painting
WHERE {
  ?artist <has nationality> <Dutch> .
  ?painting <was created by> ?artist .
}

URI--Translates our RDF from plain-languageinto something readable on the web: 
<The Nightwatch>   <was created by>   <Rembrandt van Rijn> .
