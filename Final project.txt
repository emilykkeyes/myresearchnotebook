6.3 BASTIEN
Root Ancestors  
Louis Bastien (G0240) and Marie Josep Sibikwe (G0241) are the root ancestors of the Bastien family tree.  
Marie Josep Sibikwe is married to Charles Colton (G1067) prior to her marriage to Louis Bastien. The
marriage date between Marie Josep Sibikwe and Louis Bastien is unknown, however the entire family
appear in the 1861 census in the Nipissing District. Marie Josep Sibikwe, Louis Bastien, and their children
receive a special note from the census enumerator that reads “These people are so mixed with Indian
that I scarcely know what to call them. The principle mixture is white, and they cultivate the soil so I call
them white.”248 Marie Josep Sibikwe appear in Deux Rivieres, Mattawa, and Papineau from this point
onward, with the noted ethnicity of “Indian” and “Algonquinne.” Additionally during some point she is
married to Severe St Denys (G1068).
Additionally Charles Colton is noted as the father of both Antoine Colton (G1061) and Ignace Bastien
(G0185) in a document created by the Department of Indian Affairs in 1910. The document notes that
after Charles Colton’s death, Marie Josep Sbikwe remarries Louis Bastien (G0240), and these children
are taken in and cared for by him (hence why Ignace Bastien is known as “Bastien” versus “Colton.”) It
also notes that she is “a non treaty half breed.”249  
Louis Bastien appears in the Nipissing District in 1861, Deux Rivieres in 1871, Mattawa in 1881 and 1891,
and in Papineau in 1901. He appears with varying ethnicity, including “French”, and “Ind.” Louis Bastien
acts as the godfather to children from other root families, including the Montreuils and the
Commandants. With Marie Josep Sibikwe they have four (including Ignace Bastien) children. Of these
four children their descendants are traced through Ignace Bastien and Jean Bastien.

6.7 COMMANDANT / GRANDLOUIS
Root Ancestors
The root ancestors of the Commandant‐Grandlouis family are Grand Louis Commandant (G0076) and
Mari Anne Kijikasowekwe (G0075). Grand Louis Commandant is born in 1825 in Upper Canada. Mari
Anne Kijikasowekwe is born in 1831 in Quebec. They appear together in the 1861 census in the Nipissing
District. By this point they have six children. The family receives a specific note from the census
enumerator that reads “These people are so mixed with Indian that I scarcely know what to call them.
The principle mixture is white, and they cultivate the soil so I call them white.”258 The family appears in
South Mattawa in 1871 and in Mattawa in 1881. Grand Louis Comandant’s ethnicity from this point
forward in the 1871 and 1881 census is noted as “Indian.” In 1881 his occupation is noted as a
“voyageur.” Mari Anne Kijikasowekwe mirror her husband in the 1871 census, and in the 1881 census.
However, Mari Anne Kijikasowekwe appears twice in the 1881 census, once presumably later in the year
as she is listed as “widowed.” In 1882 she marries Jawbone Antoine Nijkwiwisens (G0251) and is thus
also a root ancestor of Antoine family. Grand Louis Commandant and Mari Anne Kijikasowekwe have
nine children together, whose descendants marry into root families. These families include the
Larivieres, the Parents, and the Larondes. These descendants can be traced through their respective
family history sheets. Of their children, two are known to have been baptised at Mattawa. All of their
children (whom are known to have been married) are married at Mattawa between 1864 and 1884.
Throughout the course of their lives the children consistently appear with varying ethnicities including:
“Indian,” “Half Breed French,” “English,” “Algonquin,”, and “Ojibway.”
Xavier Commandant (G0814), their son, appears as the godfather for Joseph Xavier Lariviere in 1880.


Root Ancestors
Joseph Lariviere, b. 1835 (G0652) and Elizabeth Commandant dit Grandlouis, b. 1849 (G0653) are the
root ancestors for the Lariviere family tree. Joseph Lariviere was born in Lake of Two Mountains Quebec, and is the son of Simon Lariviere (G0913) and Therese Belair (G0912). He is married to Elizabeth
Commandant dit Grandlouis in 1864 at Mattawa. Elizabeth Commandant dit Grandlouis is the daughter
of Grand Louis Commandant (G0076) and Mari Anne Kijikasowekwe (G0075). In 1861 Elizabeth
Commandant dit Grandlouis appears in the Nipissing District, and her family receives a specific note
from the enumerator that reads “These people are so mixed with Indian that I scarcely know what to
call them. The principle mixture is white, and they cultivate the soil so I call them white.”285 Joseph
Lariviere and Elizabeth Commandant appear together in the 1881 and the 1901 census as “Half Breed
French.” Their children also have the same noted ethnicity. Joseph Lariviere appears at the Beaucage
Indian reserve in the 1901 census as “Iroquois.” Together they have eleven children, three of whom are
baptised at Mattawa. The godparents for these children are connected to other root families, including
the Antoines, and Commandant dit Grand Louis.
