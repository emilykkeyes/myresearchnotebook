Pandoc Tutorial Notes:
Don't include any note that the folder you create should not have spaces. When trying to change to the directory, I could not select the original directory because the title/name looked like this: pandoc and markdown. Once I did change it to "pandoc" I had no problem.
Instructions for installing Pandoc are terrrrrrrible.
