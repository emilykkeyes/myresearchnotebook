Big Data Tim Hitchcock
"In this instance, each of these readings, seems to reinforce a larger story about the evolution of the court, of a life, of a place - a story about the rise of the bureaucracy of the modern state, and of criminal justice. But it was largely by starting from a picture, a face, a stair of fear, that the story emerged."

Not entirely sure I agree with this statment/quote.
In a way he didn't just start with the face, and the story "emerged." Like all history, the story emerged because of what *he* say in particular. He created the story.
