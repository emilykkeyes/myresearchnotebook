Big Data Tim Hitchcock
What he seems to be arguing is that doing this kind of data analysis offers the possibility of insight into the overlooked stories (aka the stories that aren't of white dead men.) I'm not sure this is entirely the case. I can't necessairly explain why. Perhaps it is because all the data he is using comes from the studies of dead white men. It was made for their own use, not to showcase the stories of unimportant people.
