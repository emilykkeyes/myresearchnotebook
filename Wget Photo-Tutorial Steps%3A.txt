Wget Photo-Tutorial Steps:
Open CommandPrompt (search: commandprompt)

Navigate to the place you'd like to create a directory (cd ...). For this let's use desktop.

Create a new directory (mkdir wget-NAME). For this, let's use mkdir wget-lac

Navigate to this directory (cd wget-lac)

Insert command (wget and the URL for the website you are interested in) For this let's use (wget http://data2.archives.ca/e/e167/e004157817.jpg)

You should get a little message like this: SCREENSHOT.

This means your file downloaded, yahoo!

Okay, let's see how we can use this to download more.
One way to do this is by creating a text document with a whole bunch of files you want to download.
(screenshot)
Save it, and then 
Use the command wget -i name.txt
(wget -i e167.txt)

Screenshot.
Success!


Okay, apparently we can be a bit more specific with wget on what we want downloaded (so say, we only want the images downloaded from a page/site.) Let's give it a try.

Wget doesn't seem to like the url above, because it has things like 'lang' in it, which it things is a command.
What about if I add a (/) after
Nope. same result. Screenshot.

Let's try a workaround...
What if I try and shorten it? like using Google URL

So it appeared to be doing something, but didn't like it. It kept generating "550 Internal Server Error"
Eventually, after it did the same thing over and over, I stopped it by using Ctrl C (handy tip.)

Searching my original issue (command viewing things like "lang" as a command), I found this solution on stackoverflow.com (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20626273/usage-of-wget-for-a-long-url). They say to inclose my url in quotes.

So new command wget "http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayEcopies&lang=eng&rec_nbr=2666975&rec_nbr_list=99898,2666975,2667022,2666976,99897,2667020,2667016,2667025,2667000,2667018&title=[Journal+du+si%C3%A8ge+de+Qu%C3%A9bec+avec+un+d%C3%A9tail+particulier+...].+&ecopy=e004157817"
Again, appeared to be working, but this time it actually told me the name is too long, 245 characters total.
