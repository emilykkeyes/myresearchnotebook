# Why am I taking this class?
by emilykkeyes

I'm interested in taking this class because I'm hoping to learn more about Digital History. While this seems like a generic answer, I'm interested in the issues that are being discussed. On our first day Dr. Graham raised a good point, which was that historians  often get so excited about the digital that they  forget to look at it like any other source.  

Not only am I guilty of this, I can see parallels in my own research of performance history. Often an audience forgets that costumes, lighting, casting etc., is done deliberately, designed to present the events in a particular way, whether it is to make it more dramatic, relatable, etc. A helpful example is looking at the most recent adaptation of *Macbeth*. The three witches (classic and memorable characters in the story) rather than looking like this:

Look more like this:

This isn't because the director thought himself better than Shakespeare, but because creepy children provide the contemporary audience with the same cringe factor that witches provided Shakespeare's audience.

I'm also interested in learning more about Digital History for future career opportunities. Just from going over the syllabus, I can see many ways in which the skills I'll be learning could help my work as a historical researcher. The most obvious is a better learning about SNA, something we use alot in our genealogy work.

Sitting down to think about my experience with Digital History, I actually have a bit more experience than I gave myself credit for (not that this is alot.) My lovely and forward thinking parents enrolled me in [Virtual Ventures](http://carleton.ca/vv/) (a summer camp run by the Faculty of Engineering and Design at Carleotn Univerrsity), and I remember learning how to create my own website using html (complete with garish colours, and images.) It seems I couldn't escape html, as I later had to deal with it ...(line truncated)...

Other than those two examples, my experience is realtively small. I am the go to "tech" person at my office, which generally means I am in charge of fixing the printer, and setting up laptops. I also manage the company's online presence, including running the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/knowhistorycdn), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KnowHistory/), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/knowhistorycanada/) accounts.

I'd like to come away from the course having a better understanding of the nitty-gritty behind Digital History, and how these tools and programs can help my research. I can tell already that this can be done, and that the more I put in the more I will get out.
